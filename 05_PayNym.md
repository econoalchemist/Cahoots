# PayNym
Both StoneWallx2 and Stowaway transactions are built between users sharing PayNyms. The implementation of [BIP47](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0047.mediawiki) has allowed these PayNyms to be integrated with Samourai Wallet. Any wallet developer can also implement this feature. The really cool thing about using a PayNym is that it provides a static payment code that can be on public display without revealing any of the history of that PayNym or reusing any Bitcoin addresses. Furthermore, when two users follow each other with their PayNyms in the Samourai Wallet app, they establish a cryptographic connection made with some information from both PayNyms that is unique to their specific connection. This connection enables the receiving addresses to be generated while building cahoots transactions together. 

Every PayNym receives a unique avatar that can be saved in your contact list on the Samourai Wallet app.   

PayNyms are another great addition to the line up of privacy enhancing tools available from Samourai Wallet.
